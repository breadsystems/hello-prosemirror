# Hello, ProseMirror!

Just a little demo app to serve as a sandbox for experiments with [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net).

To start the dev environment:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:breadsystems/hello-prosemirror.git && cd hello-prosemirror
yarn
yarn start
```

This starts the Express.js server at localhost:3001. In a separate terminal:

```sh
yarn watch
```

This watches your files and reloads your code when they change.
